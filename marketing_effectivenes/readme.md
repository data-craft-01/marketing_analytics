Marketing effectiveness is measured by revenue generated in long/short term by a campaigns and by how well the company's costs of customer acquisition are lowered during that campaign.

-	Short-term revenue = new orders received X number of new customers won X ABV
-	Long-term revenue = CLTV (avg annual profit / customer X avg number of years those customers buy from business)

Example:
•	Avg profit/customer is $400 over a lifetime of 3 years
•	CAC (ustomer acquisition cost) = $50
•	Hence, CLV = $400 - $50 = $350  

•	Marketing campaign acquired 100 new customers with AOV (Average Order Value) of $80.
•	Short-term revenue = 100 new cust x $80 AOV = $8,000 
•	Long-term revenue = With a customer retention rate of 50 % --> 50 repeat customers from this campaign = 50 retained cust x $350 (CLV)= $17,500 

Total Revenue from campaign = $8,000  + $25,500
